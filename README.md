# The Things Network & Azure IoT: a perfect combination
## DotNed Saturday 2017 - IoT Workshop

This workshop is all about you, getting your hands on some amazing pieces of technology. 

First, you will be introduced to The Things Network (the first ever, community-powered, global IoT network). Start building a solution that collects sensor information using a device with an enormous wireless range potential at extremely low power consumption. 

Next, you will learn how this network can integrate with Azure to ingest data on a massive scale and take action on incoming events. You will build some hardware, write (or copy) a couple of lines of code, configure a few things and end up with a fully working solution. 

The workshop content is highly curated to offer developers, of all sorts and backgrounds, an accelerated experience in the field of IoT. On top of that, there will be a team of experts present to help out and have an inspiring conversation with.

Technologies covered are: `LoRaWAN`, `TTN Technology`, `Arduino`, `Azure IoT Hub`, `Azure Event Hubs`, `Azure Stream Analytics` and `Azure Functions`
