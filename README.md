# The Things Network Azure IoT Hub Integration

This is an example integration between The Things Network and Azure IoT Hub. This integration will be offered as a bridge, which features creating devices in the Azure IoT Hub device registry as well as sending events from uplink messages.

*Note: in this workshop we will build a simple bridge, running on your own computer. See the [full example](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/examples/tree/master/integrations/azure) on how to deploy this bridge as a WebJob to Azure.*

## Prerequisites

1. Nodejs [download here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Version 4.5 should be fine
2. Azure account
3. TTN account

## Create an Azure IoT Hub

Follow these steps to create an Azure IoT Hub.

1. Log into the [azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). The portal will be shown
2. On the left a number of Azure services os shown. Select `More Services` to open a list with all services. Filter it with `Iot Hub`
3. Select `Iot Hub` and a new blade will be shown. Select `Add` and you will be asked to enter the information needed to create an IoT Hub
4. Enter a unique IoT Hub name eg. `TechDays42ih`
5. Create a new Resource Group eg. `TechDays42rg`
6. Select `West Europe` for the location
7. Press `Create` and the portal will start creating the service. Once it is created, a notification is shown. In the right upper corner a bell represents all notifications shown

Creating an IoT Hub takes some time. Meanwhile we will create the bridge.


### Create a bridge

Follow these steps to create the integration bridge between The Things Network and Azure IoT Hub.

1. In a new folder, run `npm init` to initialize a new WebJob using Node.js. Use `server.js` as entry point
2. Run `npm install --save ttn-azure-iothub` to install this package
3. Create a new file `server.js`

This server file will be created below but we need some secrets. We will have to collect the unique keys of the TTN app and the Azure IoT Hub first.


## TTN App secrets

This integration requires the AppEUI and App Access Key from the TTN portal.

TODO - new portal????

These are the secrets needed from TTN.

## Azure IoT Hub secrets

This integration requires an shared access policy key name with Registry write and Device connect permissions. In this example, we use the **iothubowner** policy which has these permissions enabled by default.

1. Check the Azure portal notifications. The IoT Hub should be created by now.
2. On the left, select `Resource groups`
3. select the ResourceGroup `TechDays42rg`. It will open a new blade with all resources.
4. select the IoT Hub `TechDays42ih` It will open a new blade with the IoT Hub.
5. The IoTHub has not received any messages yet. Check the general settings for `Shared access policies`
6. Navigate to the 'iothubowner' policy and remember the primary key.
7. Also remember the name of the IoT Hub eg 'TechDays42ih'

These are the secrets needed from Azure.

## Create server.js

Create a file named server.js in the new folder.

```js
'use strict';

const ttnazureiot = require('ttn-azure-iothub');

// Replace with your AppEUI and App Access Key
const appEUI = '<insert AppEUI>';
const appAccessKey = '<insert App Access Key>';

// Replace with your Azure IoT Hub name and key
const hubName = '<insert hub name>';
const keyName = 'iothubowner';
const key = '<insert key>';

const bridge = new ttnazureiot.Bridge(appEUI, appAccessKey, hubName, keyName, key);

bridge.on('ttn-connect', () => {
  console.log('TTN connected');
});

bridge.on('error', err => {
  console.warn('Error', err);
});

bridge.on('uplink', data => {
  console.log('Uplink', data);
});
```

## Start the bridge

4. Run `npm start` to verify that the bridge works in the new folder. This is example output:
```
TTN connected

```
    

You are now ready to process your data in an Azure Stream Analytics job.
