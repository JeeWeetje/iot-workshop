# Handling The Things Network telemetry in Azure

This is an example of how uplink messages from The Things Network can be handled in Azure. In this workshop you will pass telemetry to Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Functions. To connect Azure Stream Analytics with Azure Functions, you will add an Azure Event Hub too.

*Note: This workshop has an open end. It provides a solid solution on how to handled telemetry programmatically in Azure. From there on it's up to you to add more Azure services.*
