# The Things Network & Azure IoT in unison
## Passing commands back to a device

This is an example of how downlink commands are sent back to a device. In this workshop, we will send commands back to faulty devices, using an Azure Function, to start them up again. 

![alt tag](img/arch/azure-telemetry-pipeline-commands.png)

This part of the workshop supports both to the [TTN Node](TheThingsNetwork.md) and to the [UWP app](UwpToIotHub.md). 

*Note: In this workshop, we will create uniquely named Azure resources. The suggested names could be reserved already.*

### Prerequisites

1. Azure account [create here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) _(Azure passes will be present for those who have no Azure account)_
2. A running TTN node connected to the TTN network and a running TTN bridge on your PC and connected to an IoT Hub
3. or... a UWP app which simulates a machine running duty cycles
4. A combination of Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics job, Event Hub and Azure Function which are waiting for analyzed telemetry coming from the devices
5. A running Device Explorer or IoT Hub Explorer, connected to the IoT Hub, showing the telemetry coming in

### Steps to perform in this part of the workshop

At the end of this part of the workshop, the following steps are performed

1. Creating commands to send back
2. Handle commands in the devices
   1. Handle commands in the TTN Node
   2. Handle commands in a UWP app

## Creating commands for devices which are in a faulty state

In the [previous workshop](Azure.md), we passed the telemetry from the device to a Stream Analytics job. This job collected devices which are sending error states. Every two minutes, information about devices that are in a faulty state are passed to an Azure Function.

In this workshop, we will react on these devices by sending them a command to 'repair themselves'. 

### Updating the Azure Function with sending command logic

First, we update the Azure Function. For each device which is passed on, we send a command back.

Sending commands back to devices is a specific feature of the IoT Hub. The IoT Hub registers devices and their security policies. And the IoT Hub has built-in logic to send commands back.

1. On the left, select `Resource groups`. A list of resource groups is shown

    ![alt tag](img/azure-resource-groups.png)

2. Select the ResourceGroup `IoTWorkshop-rg`. It will open a new blade with all resources in this group
3. Select the Azure Function App `IoTWorkshop-fa`
4. To the left, the current functions are shown. Select `IoTWorkshopEventHubFunction`

    ![alt tag](img/commands/azure-functions-functions.png)

5. The Code panel is shown. The code of the function is shown. *Note: this code is saved in a file named run.scx*
6. Change the current code into

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
    using System.Text;
    using Newtonsoft.Json; 

    public static void Run(string myEventHubMessage, TraceWriter log)
    {
      log.Info($"Stream Analytics produced {myEventHubMessage}");  

      // Connect to IoT Hub   
      var connectionString = "[IOT HUB connection string]";
      var serviceClient = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
    
      // Send commands to all devices 
      var messages = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<StreamAnalyticsCommand[]>(myEventHubMessage);

      log.Info($"{messages.Length} messages arrived.");

      foreach(var message in messages)
      {
        var bytes= new byte[1];
        bytes[0] = 42; // restart the machine!
        var commandMessage = new Message(bytes);
        serviceClient.SendAsync(message.deviceid, commandMessage);

        // Log
        log.Info($"Machine restart command processed after {message.count} errors for {message.deviceid}");
      }
    }

    public class StreamAnalyticsCommand
    {
      public string deviceid {get; set;}
      public int count {get; set;}
    }
    ```

7. Press the `Logs` button to open the pane which shows some basic logging

    ![alt tag](img/azure-function-app-eventhubtrigger-logs.png)

8. A 'Logs' panel is shown. This 'Logs' panel works like a trace log.
9. If you try to run this code, you will notice that compilation fails. This is not that surprising: we are using certain libraries that Azure Functions has no knowledge of. Yet!
10. Press the `View Files` button to open the pane which shows a directory tree of all files.

    ![alt tag](img/commands/azure-function-app-view-files.png)

11. In the pane you can see that the file currently selected is: run.csx

    ![alt tag](img/commands/azure-function-app-view-files-pane.png)

12. Add a new file by pressing `Add`

    ![alt tag](img/commands/azure-function-app-view-files-pane-add.png)

13. Name the new file `project.json`

    ![alt tag](img/commands/azure-function-app-view-files-pane-add-file.png)

14. Press `Enter` to confirm the name of the file and an empty code editor will be shown for this file.
15. The Project.json file describes which Nuget packages have to be referenced. Fill the editor with the following code 

    ```json
    {
      "frameworks": {
        "net46": {
          "dependencies": {
            "Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client": "5.2.3",
            "Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core": "5.2.3",
            "Microsoft.Azure.Amqp": "1.1.5",
            "Microsoft.Azure.Devices": "1.1.0",
            "Newtonsoft.Json": "9.0.1"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

16. Select `Save`. The changed C# code will be recompiled immediately *Note: you can press 'save and run', this will actually run the function, but an empty test will be passed (check out the 'Test' option to the right for more info)*
17. In the 'Logs' panel, just below 'Code', `verify the outcome` of the compilation

    ```
    2017-01-08T14:49:46.794 Packages restored.
    2017-01-08T14:49:47.113 Script for function 'IoTWorkshopEventHubFunction' changed. Reloading.
    2017-01-08T14:49:47.504 Compilation succeeded.
    ```

18. There is just one thing left to do: we have to fill in the Azure IoT Hub security policy connection string. To send commands back, we have to proof we are authorized to do this
19. In the Azure Function, replace '[IOT HUB connection string]' your *remembered* IoT Hub `Connection String-primary key`
20. Recompile again succesfully

Now, the Azure Function is ready to receive data about devices which simulate 'faulty machines'. And it can send commands back to 'repair' the 'machines'.

## Handle commands in the devices

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture10-stream-data-to-an-event-hub.png)

Let's bring your device in a faulty state and see how the Azure IoT Platforms sends back a command to repair it.

You can work with TTN devices or with the UWP app which simulates a device.

### Handle commands in the TTN Node

In [TTN Node](TheThingsNetwork.md), we assembled a TTN node and we put a sketch (source code) on it. Here we will add more logic to the node.

1. Go back to the Arduino IDE and select the sketch
2. Alter the sketch, Add the 'ttn.onMessage(handleCommand);' in the setup function:

    ```c
    // Initializing TTN communication...
    ttn.onMessage(handleCommand);
    ttn.personalize(devAddr, nwkSKey, appSKey);
    ```

3. Every time a message is sent to the TTN backend, the node checks for commands. When a command is received, the handleCommand function will be called
4. Add the extra function 'handleCommand' at the end of the sketch

    ```c
    void handleCommand(const byte* payload, size_t length, port_t port) {
      if (length > 0) {
        int command = payload[0];
    
        if (command >= 42) {
          errorCode = 0;
          digitalWrite(commLed, HIGH);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5. In the **Sketch** menu, click **Upload**. *Note: The sketch is uploaded and again telemetry will arrive at the TTN Portal, the TTN Azure bridge and the IoTHub*
6. **Push** the button attached to the node and `hold` it until the LED is unlit. The 'machine' is now in an 'error' state
7. **Check out** the bridge. The node is not updating the cycles anymore and error 99 is passed

    ![alt tag](img/commands/TTN-Errors-arrive.png)

8. After a few errors within two minutes (the same time frame Stream Analytics is checking), **Check out** the Azure Function. It will handle the event message.

    ```
    2017-01-13T14:09:17.188 Function started (Id=ed3a2175-33e6-4698-a76c-5831b2ea86a1)
    2017-01-13T14:09:17.646 Stream Analytics produced [{"count":2,"deviceid":"predictive_maintenance_machine_42"}]
    2017-01-13T14:09:17.724 1 messages arrived.
    2017-01-13T14:09:17.833 Machine restart command processed after 2 errors for predictive_maintenance_machine_42
    2017-01-13T14:09:17.833 Function completed (Success, Id=ed3a2175-33e6-4698-a76c-5831b2ea86a1)
    ```

9. **Check out** the bridge again. It will now handle the command (Downlink message) and send it to the TTN portal

    ![alt tag](img/commands/TTN-Errors-arrive-at-bridge.png)

10. **Check out** the TTN portal, the data pane. It will now handle the command (Downlink message) and send it to the device, one the first moment a new uplink message arrives

    ![alt tag](img/commands/TTN-Errors-arrive-at-ttn.png)

11. Finally, **check out** the logging of the node. The commands arrives and is handled by the function in the sketch

    ![alt tag](img/commands/TTN-Errors-arrive-at-node.png)

12. And in the end, the device will lit the light of the LED again. The 'machine' is now running again

We have now gone full circle: the machine on hold, simulated by the TTN Node, is running again and it's updating the machine cycles number again. And again, it's running without an error state.

### Handle commands in a UWP app

In [UWP app](UwpToIotHub.md) we wrote and executed a UWP which send some telemetry. Here we will add more logic to the node so we can receive commands.

1. Go to the UWP project
2. `Open` the file named 'AzureIoTHub.cs'
3. The class in this file also contains a method 'ReceiveCloudToDeviceMessageAsync' which is not that smart. It can only receive text. We want to receive a number (bytes) from the Azure IoT Platform
4. `Add` a Receive method with the following code

    ```csharp
    public static async Task<byte[]> ReceiveCloudToDeviceBytes()
    {
        var deviceClient = DeviceClient.
              CreateFromConnectionString(deviceConnectionString, TransportType.Amqp);

        while (true)
        {
            var receivedMessage = await deviceClient.ReceiveAsync();

            if (receivedMessage != null)
            {
                var bytes = receivedMessage.GetBytes();

                await deviceClient.CompleteAsync(receivedMessage);

                return bytes;
            }

            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
        }
    }
    ```
    
5. Now, the method to receive messages from the cloud to this devices is waiting for bytes
6. Next, `Open` the XAML of form 'MainPage.xaml'
7. `Add` the following line of code. It add a button to the screen

    ```xml
    <Button Name="BtnReceive" Content="Wait for commands" Margin="5" FontSize="60" Click="btnReceive_Click" />
    ```

8. Finally, `add` the following code-behind on 'MainPage.xaml.cs'. This is the logic which will be executed after pushing the new button

    ```csharp
    private async void btnReceive_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        BtnReceive.IsEnabled = false;
        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                var bytes = await AzureIoTHub.ReceiveCloudToDeviceBytes();

                if (bytes != null && bytes.Length > 0 && bytes[0] >= 42)
                {
                    await ShowMessage($"Command {Convert.ToInt32(bytes[0])} (Started running again at {DateTime.Now:hh:mm:ss})");
                    _errorCode = 0;
                    BtnBreak.IsEnabled = true;

                    txbTitle.Foreground = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.DarkOliveGreen);
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                BtnReceive.IsEnabled = true;
                await ShowMessage(ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

9. We only have to push the button once. After that, when a command is received. We 'start' the machine again
10. The changes in the code are done. `recompile` to check the code will build successfully
11. Restart the UWP app, press `Send cycle updates` a couple of times

    ![alt tag](img/commands/UWP-app-sending-duty-cycles.png)

12. The cycles are normal behavior. And these will not be picked up by the Stream Analytics job (which is listening for the error status)
13. To receive commands, we have to wait for them to be received from the IoT Hub. Press `Wait for commands` *note: the communication with the IoT Hub is based on a communication protocol named AMQP by default. This makes communication very efficient, we are not polling every few seconds and thus saving bandwidth*

    ![alt tag](img/commands/UWP-app-command-waiting.png)

14. Now we 'break' the machine by pressing `Break down`. *Note: the title will be shown in a red color*

    ![alt tag](img/commands/UWP-app-break-down.png)

15. finally, we send telemetry, a few times to notify the Azure IoT platform (using the IoT Hub) that the machine in in a faulty state
16. In the UWP app, again press `Send cycle updates` a couple of times. Error code 99 is shown

    ![alt tag](img/commands/UWP-app-send-faulty-state.png)
 
17. The telemetry is sent to the IoTHub which passes the data to the StreamAnalytics job. If the error codes arrive multiple times within the same time frame (the hopping window is two minutes), an event is constructed and passed to the Azure Function.
18. The Azure function will show the execution of the method

    ```
    2017-01-08T15:45:07.169 Function started (Id=91558474-1e83-4ce5-b9ca-81b87f22dff4)
    2017-01-08T15:45:07.169 Stream Analytics produced [{"count":3,"deviceid":"MachineCyclesUwp"}]
    2017-01-08T15:45:07.169 1 messages arrived.
    2017-01-08T15:45:07.169 Machine restart command processed after 3 errors for MachineCyclesUwp
    2017-01-08T15:45:07.169 Function completed (Success, Id=91558474-1e83-4ce5-b9ca-81b87f22dff4)
    ```

19. Notice that the event is actually a JSON array of messages (containing one message). And correct machine is restarted
20. Now look at the UWP app, the machine is restart, just a second or so after the command was sent by the Azure Function *Note: the title is no longer red*

    ![alt tag](img/commands/UWP-app-restart.png)
 
We have now successfully sent some telemetry which is picked up and handled. In the end, commands were received and acted on.

Receiving commands from Azure completes the main part of the workshop.

We hope you did enjoy working with the Azure IoT Platform, as much as we did. Thanks for getting this far!

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture13-make-the-world-a-better-place.png)

But wait, there is still more. We added two bonus chapters to the workshop

1. [Runnning the TTN C# bridge which supports downlink](Webjob.md)
2. [Add basic monitoring to the platform](IoTPatformMonitoring.md)
